1. Agents with abnormally higher or lower volume compared to historical norms:
   - Higher: D, E, I, K
   - Lower: B, L

2. Confidence values or statistical measures:
   - To provide confidence values or statistical measures, we would need more data such as the standard deviation or variance of the historical data. However, we can make a rough estimate by calculating the percentage change from the historical average to the current volume. For example, for agent B, the volume has decreased by 50% ((150-75)/150), which is a significant change.

3. P-values for the identified deviations:
   - To calculate p-values, we would need to perform a statistical test such as a t-test or z-test. These tests require additional information such as the standard deviation or variance of the historical data and the sample size. Without this information, it's not possible to calculate p-values.

4. Insights on the overall data volume and sparsity:
   - The data volume is relatively small with only 12 agents, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions. The data is also sparse with only two data points per agent. This lack of data could lead to overfitting if we were to build a predictive model. 
   - The identified outliers could be due to random chance or they could indicate a real change in performance. Without more data, it's difficult to determine the cause of these deviations. 
   - To get a more reliable answer, we would need more data points over a longer period of time. This would allow us to calculate measures of variability and perform statistical tests.
