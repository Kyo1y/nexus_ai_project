1. To identify agents with abnormally higher or lower volume compared to historical norms, we can calculate the percentage change between the historical average and the current volume. If the percentage change is significantly high (say, more than 20%), we can consider the agent's volume as abnormal. 

   Based on this, the agents with abnormal volumes are:
   - Agent D: Increased volume (11.11% increase)
   - Agent E: Increased volume (2.82% increase)
   - Agent H: Increased volume (50% increase)
   - Agent I: Increased volume (40% increase)
   - Agent K: Increased volume (66.67% increase)
   - Agent L: Decreased volume (83.33% decrease)

2. Confidence values or statistical measures can be calculated using standard deviation or Z-score. However, given the data, we don't have enough information to calculate these measures. We would need a larger dataset that includes the distribution of volumes for each agent over a period of time.

3. P-values are used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability that the results of your test occurred at random. If p-value is low (typically â‰¤ 0.05), it indicates that the probability of the hypothesis being true is high. However, to calculate p-values, we need to perform a statistical test like a t-test or chi-square test, which requires more data than what is provided.

4. The overall data volume seems to be quite varied, with some agents handling a high volume of work and others handling a very low volume. This could indicate a wide range of performance levels or different work capacities among the agents. The data is sparse and does not provide enough information to make definitive conclusions about the performance of the agents. The identified outliers show significant deviations from their historical averages, which could be due to a variety of factors such as changes in work capacity, efficiency, or workload. Further investigation would be needed to determine the cause of these deviations.
