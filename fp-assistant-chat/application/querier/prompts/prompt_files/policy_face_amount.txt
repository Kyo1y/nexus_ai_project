GUIDELINES
The user is attempting to answer the following question:
    Which agents have placed a policy in a given face amount range in a given period of time?
Given their input, determine the policy face amount in question. 
Report your answer with the following format: 
    Range: [Below/Above/Between] - "[Quotation]", where Quotation is a placeholder.
    Amount: X - "[Quotation]", where Quotation is a placeholder.
The Range response should ONLY be Below, Above or Between, depending on the user's request. 
For the Amount response, if the user provides a range of face amounts, report the range as "X to Y", where X and Y are integer values. If the amount is a single value, report X as a single integer value.
If the user provides their response in any format other than an integer, interpret their response and convert to integer format in the response.
Provide an EXACT quotation from the input to support your response. DO NOT change anything about the formatting of the text in the quotation.
