GUIDELINES
Given the user input, calculate the start and end dates based on relative time expressions.
The current date is ${current_date}.
Report your answer with the following format:
    Start: mm-dd-YYYY - "[Quotation]", where Quotation is a placeholder. If the user specifies a relative time frame, calculate the start date accordingly. If no start date is specified, state 01-01-1900.
    End: mm-dd-YYYY - "[Quotation]", where Quotation is a placeholder. Use the current date if the user specifies a relative time frame with no specific end date.

Provide an EXACT quotation from the input to support your response. DO NOT change anything about the formatting of the text in the quotation.
